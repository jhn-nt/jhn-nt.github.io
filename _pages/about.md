Giovanni Angelotti is a Doctoral Researcher at the [Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/) USI-SUPSI in Switzerland, focusing on neural-causal inference.  

His research aimes to develop inference and reasoning models to enhance risk mitigation strategies and support high-stakes decision making based on real world evidence.  
Giovanni has an extensive expertise in applied research on electronic health records and multimodal clinical data. He has worked with data from health facilities across three continents, in both industry and academia.


Prior to his graduate studies, Giovanni obtained his Master's Degree from Politecnico di Milano in Biomedical Engineering at [SPINLabs](https://www.spinlabs.deib.polimi.it/) in 2017, after developing his thesis at [MIT LCP](https://lcp.mit.edu/) in Boston. He then worked as Lead Data Scientist at [Humanitas Research Hospital](https://www.humanitas.net/) in Milan.   
Giovanni co-organized the first two editions of [ESICM](https://www.esicm.org/) Datatalk and MIT Datathon in Milan in 2019 and 2020, amongst the largest AI events in critical care in Europe at the time.

Giovanni is a research affiliate at [MIT Critical Data](https://criticaldata.mit.edu/), a global ecosystem of healthcare and data science professionals advocating for AI equity in research. He is also a member of the IDSIA [Imprecise Probability Group](https://ipg.idsia.ch/) and of the [Machine Learning for Bioinformatics and Personalized Medicine Group](https://www.sib.swiss/directory/group/machine-learning-for-bioinformatics-and-personalised-medicine) at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.
